# ==================== SmolVLA Inference Configuration ====================
go_bag_path: /your_bag_path # Provide full bag path for inference

policy_type: 'smolvla' # SmolVLA sequential policy
use_delta: false # Delta action (not supported yet)
eval_episodes: 50 # Number of evaluation episodes
seed: 42 # Random seed
start_seed: 42 # Episode start seed
device: 'cuda' # or "cpu"

# ==================== Model Path Configuration ====================
# Points to SmolVLA sequential training outputs

# Task selection: Change this to evaluate different tasks
# Options:
#   - task1_moving_grasp: Moving target grasping from conveyor belt
#   - task2_weighing: Package weighing
#   - task3_placement: Daily chemical product placement
#   - task4_sorting: Full process sorting
task: 'smolvla_sequential/task1_moving_grasp'
method: 'smolvla_sequential'
timestamp: 'run_20251011_100000' # Change to your training timestamp
epoch: 'best' # or specific epoch number like 10, 20

# ==================== Language Instruction Configuration ====================
# SmolVLA uses language instructions to condition the policy
# Change this based on which task you're evaluating

# Task 1: Moving target grasping
language_instruction: "Pick up the moving object from the conveyor belt, place it on the table, and push it to the designated area"

# Task 2: Package weighing (uncomment to use)
# language_instruction: "Pick up the package from the conveyor belt, weigh it on the electronic scale, then pick it up again and place it in the designated storage container"

# Task 3: Product placement (uncomment to use)
# language_instruction: "Pick up the daily chemical product bottle, transfer it to the other hand, and place it in the designated location with the label facing up"

# Task 4: Full process sorting (uncomment to use)
# language_instruction: "Move from the starting position, pick up the workpiece, move to the designated location and place it precisely"

# ==================== Multi-Task Evaluation Configuration ====================
# For evaluating all 4 tasks sequentially, use this configuration

# Enable multi-task evaluation (optional)
multi_task_eval: false # Set to true to evaluate all tasks

# If multi_task_eval is true, define tasks to evaluate
tasks_to_evaluate:
  - task_id: 1
    task_name: 'task1_moving_grasp'
    language_instruction: "Pick up the moving object from the conveyor belt, place it on the table, and push it to the designated area"
    episodes: 10
  - task_id: 2
    task_name: 'task2_weighing'
    language_instruction: "Pick up the package from the conveyor belt, weigh it on the electronic scale, then pick it up again and place it in the designated storage container"
    episodes: 10
  - task_id: 3
    task_name: 'task3_placement'
    language_instruction: "Pick up the daily chemical product bottle, transfer it to the other hand, and place it in the designated location with the label facing up"
    episodes: 10
  - task_id: 4
    task_name: 'task4_sorting'
    language_instruction: "Move from the starting position, pick up the workpiece, move to the designated location and place it precisely"
    episodes: 10

# ==================== Environment Configuration ====================
max_episode_steps: 500 # Maximum episode steps
env_name: Kuavo-Sim # Kuavo SmolVLA simulation environment name

# ==================== SmolVLA Specific Notes ====================
# 1. Image size MUST be 512x512 (SmolVLA requirement)
# 2. Policy outputs 50-frame action chunks, but only first step is executed
# 3. Action dimension is 32D, but only first 16D are used for Kuavo control
# 4. Language instruction is REQUIRED for SmolVLA inference
# 5. To evaluate different tasks, change both 'task' and 'language_instruction'
# 6. Model path format: outputs/train/smolvla_sequential/task{N}_{name}/best
